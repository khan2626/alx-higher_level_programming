0x02. Python - import & modules
1) Write a program that imports the function def add(a, b): from the file add_0.py and prints the result of the addition 1 + 2 = 3

2) Write a program that imports functions from the file calculator_1.py, does some Maths, and prints the result.

Do not use the function print (with string format to display integers) more than 4 times
You have to define:
the value 10 to a variable a
the value 5 to a variable b

3) Write a program that prints the number of and the list of its arguments.

The output should be:
Number of argument(s) followed by argument (if number is one) or arguments (otherwise), followed by
: (or . if no arguments were passed) followed by
a new line, followed by (if at least one argument),

4) Write a program that prints the result of the addition of all arguments

The output should be the result of the addition of all arguments, followed by a new line
You can cast arguments into integers by using int() (you can assume that all arguments can be casted into integers)
Your code should not be executed when imported

5) Write a program that prints all the names defined by the compiled module hidden_4.pyc (please download it locally).

You should print one name per line, in alpha order
You should print only names that do not start with __
Your code should not be executed when imported
Make sure you are running your code in Python3.8.x (hidden_4.pyc has been compiled with this version)

6) Write a program that imports the variable a from the file variable_load_5.py and prints its value.

You are not allowed to use * for importing or __import__
Your code should not be executed when imported
