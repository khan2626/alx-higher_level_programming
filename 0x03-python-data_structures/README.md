0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

0) Write a function that prints all integers of a list.

1) Write a function that retrieves an element from a list like in C.

Prototype: def element_at(my_list, idx):
If idx is negative, the function should return None
If idx is out of range (> of number of element in my_list), the function should return None
You are not allowed to import any module
You are not allowed to use try/except

2) Write a function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C).

Prototype: def replace_in_list(my_list, idx, element):
If idx is negative, the function should not modify anything, and returns the original list
If idx is out of range (> of number of element in my_list), the function should not modify anything, and returns the original list
You are not allowed to import any module
You are not allowed to use try/except

3) Write a function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.

4) Write a function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C).

Prototype: def new_in_list(my_list, idx, element):
If idx is negative, the function should return a copy of the original list
If idx is out of range (> of number of element in my_list), the function should return a copy of the original list
You are not allowed to import any module
You are not allowed to use try/except

5) Write a function that removes all characters c and C from a string.

Prototype: def no_c(my_string):
The function should return the new string
You are not allowed to import any module
You are not allowed to use str.replace()

6) Write a function that prints a matrix of integers.

7) Write a function that adds 2 tuples.

Prototype: def add_tuple(tuple_a=(), tuple_b=()):
Returns a tuple with 2 integers:
The first element should be the addition of the first element of each argument
The second element should be the addition of the second element of each argument

8) Write a function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.

9) Write a function that finds the biggest integer of a list.

10) Write a function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.

Prototype: def divisible_by_2(my_list=[]):
Return a new list with True or False, depending on whether the integer at the same position in the original list is a multiple of 2

11) Write a function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list.

12) Complete the source code in order to switch value of a and b
