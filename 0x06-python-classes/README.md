0x06. Python - Classes and Objects

Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc
All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)


Task 0.
Write an empty class Square that defines a square:

You are not allowed to import any module

Task 1.
Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 0-square.py)

Private instance attribute: size
Instantiation with size (no type/value verification)
You are not allowed to import any module
Task 2.
Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 1-square.py)

Private instance attribute: size
Instantiation with optional size: def __init__(self, size=0):
size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0
You are not allowed to import any module

Task 3.
Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 2-square.py)

Private instance attribute: size
Instantiation with optional size: def __init__(self, size=0):
size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0
Public instance method: def area(self): that returns the current square area
You are not allowed to import any module

Task 4.
Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 3-square.py)

Private instance attribute: size:
property def size(self): to retrieve it
property setter def size(self, value): to set it:
size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0
Instantiation with optional size: def __init__(self, size=0):
Public instance method: def area(self): that returns the current square area
You are not allowed to import any module

Task 5.
Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 4-square.py)

Private instance attribute: size:
property def size(self): to retrieve it
property setter def size(self, value): to set it:
size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0
Instantiation with optional size: def __init__(self, size=0):
Public instance method: def area(self): that returns the current square area
Public instance method: def my_print(self): that prints in stdout the square with the character #:
if size is equal to 0, print an empty line
You are not allowed to import any module

Task 6.
Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 5-square.py)

Private instance attribute: size:
property def size(self): to retrieve it
property setter def size(self, value): to set it:
size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0
Private instance attribute: position:
property def position(self): to retrieve it
property setter def position(self, value): to set it:
position must be a tuple of 2 positive integers, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message position must be a tuple of 2 positive integers
Instantiation with optional size and optional position: def __init__(self, size=0, position=(0, 0)):
Public instance method: def area(self): that returns the current square area
Public instance method: def my_print(self): that prints in stdout the square with the character #:
if size is equal to 0, print an empty line
position should be use by using space - Don’t fill lines by spaces when position[1] > 0
You are not allowed to import any module
